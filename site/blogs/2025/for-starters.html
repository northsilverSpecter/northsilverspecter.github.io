        <h1>For Starters | 2-6-2025</h1>
        
        <p>Now for the first blog, I'm gonna yap about some stuff
        that I do and like about it. If you check my
        <a href="../../about-me/index.html">about me</a>, I have some
        tools and such on how I do things. I'll start with my comic
        drawing works.</p>
        
        <h2>As a comic artist...</h2>
        <p>I mostly draw in traditional art, preferrably pencil and paper,
        but I use a brush and fountain pen as my main inking tools.
        My artstyle is simply cartoony but I do hatching shadows and 
        adding some detail to my work, just not in your usual cartoons style
        because I had a hard time with lineweight with a brush pen, making
        most of my outlines with fountain pen first. I also mention that I 
        don't use color on my drawings, purely because again: Manga Influence ;)</p>
        
        <p>Now comic-wise, I oddly make the reading flow in the manga way
        (Aka Right-to-Left) because its influence do inspire me that makes
        it quite unusual. The storytelling would be relatively simple like
        all webcomic creators, about everyone revolves around character-
        driven stories that simplifies plot structure. I am eager to learn
        more of the comic techniques and anything, just a matter of time
        I would post a full comic.</p>
        
        <p>Speaking of posting, I do plan to post some drawing at the 
        Image Gallary but for the sake of time constraints when working 
        on this blog and website, it may take some time so be patient!
        I may create a seperate comic section of the Image gallary, but there
        could be a way to implemented this. For now, simple drawings first!</p>

        <h2>As a programmer (game dev?)</h2>
        <p>If you notice on my dedicated <b>Sidebar Spot™</b> at your right
        side of the screen (or... if you're at desktop view on mobile?),
        I do have an unfinished itch.io page that wasn't even ready yet
        because I'm lazy about it. If you want to know more about my
        programming stuff, I'll say it:</p>
        
        <p><b>I don't use a game engine</b>, odd right? I prefer what's
        called a <i>game framework</i> which is the roots of game engines,
        the reason why I prefer game frameworks is that it's not heavy to
        use like Unity or Gamemaker. You might say <b>"But north! You could've 
        used godot! it's easy to learn with gdscript!"</b>, you were right 
        but I do feel comfortable with an older programming language called the
        "C programming language" despite the hard syntax. A developer chooses 
        their own engine that fits their needs, You can take it with a 
        grain of salt just in case, you can search the programming language
        if you're curious.</p>
        
        <p>Now, my game framework of choice: <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">
        Raylib</a>. It's quite a framework that I tried using for a few attempts
        during my search on finding a game engine, the framework felt right for
        me because of its simplicity and a ton of examples for me to learn. 
        Not to mention it's has other languages, It uses C as the main 
        language and took me time with tutorials to learn it.</p>
        
        <p>I have experiment with a few projects in raylib but they're not
        worthy to be in an Itch.io page, there's quite more to learn about it.
        Speaking of my basic level of programming along with making this website,
        the itch.io page also have to wait next to my comics. I wouldn't consider my
        blogs as a "devblog"? just perhaps I like to yap on my future game's progress
        so it goes as a matter of time itself.</p>
        
        <h2>Lastfully</h2>
        <p>So in an odd conclusion of this first blog, you get to know me a little...
        maybe, perhaps idk! Sort of weird typing this in an html file but
        also makes it meditative to write about it when I have music, there's quite
        stuff going on and you may notice the latest blog just now. That's 
        pretty much it for my yapping, You can leave the site to not waste time
        or just apprechiate the clouds from the website's header. It's your call ;)</p>
